# RA-GA
The code of RA-GA algorithm, which combines a wrapper-based genetic algorithm with a ranking aggregation filter technique to address the feature selection issue.

## Description
Feature selection is the process of finding the most relevant variables for a predictive model. These techniques can be used to identify and remove unneeded, irrelevant and redundant features that do not contribute or decrease the accuracy of the predictive model.

In nature, the genes of organisms tend to evolve over successive generations to better adapt to the environment. The Genetic Algorithm is an heuristic optimization method inspired by that procedures of natural evolution.

In feature selection, the function to optimize is the generalization performance of a predictive model. More specifically, we want to minimize the error of the model on an independent data set not used to create the model.
